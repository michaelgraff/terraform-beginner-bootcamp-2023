# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1 Journal

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
- PROJECT_ROOT
  |-- variables.tf           # stores the structure of input variables
  |-- main.tf                # everything else 
  |-- providers.tf           # defined required providers and their configuration
  |-- outputs.tf             # stores our outputs
  |-- terraform.tfvars       # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
  |-- README.md              # required for TF modules
```

## Terraform Cloud Variables

In Terraform Cloud we can set two kinds of variables

- Environment Variables - shell variables that you would normally set in your shell profile and are used during plan and apply runs in the cloud 
- Terraform Variables - variables that you would normally set in your terraform.tfvars file

When creating variables in Terraform Cloud, you can set them to be sensitive so they can no longer be viewed after being input.

## Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag

We can use the `-var` flag to override a defined input variable in the terraform.tfvars file at run time 

### var-file flag

To set lots of variables, it is more convenient to specify their values in a variable definitions file (with a filename ending in either .tfvars or .tfvars.json) and then specify that file on the command line with -var-file:

### terraform.tfvars 

this is the default file that is used to bring in variables in bulk

### auto.tvfars

Terraform auto loads tfvars files only when they are named terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json.

Is it possible to ensure that tfvars files following custom naming schemes are loaded automatically?

It is in fact possible to name your file whatever you wish and have Terraform load it automatically. All we have to do is provide the file name with .auto.tfvars as an extension. Letâ€™s try it out.

## Dealing with Configuration Drift

### Fix Missing resources with Terraform Import

If your state file is lost you can can use [Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import) to import existing resources back into your Terraform State.

### Fix Manual Configuration of Resources

If resources have been manually changed via ClickOps but the original configuration is in your state file, this can be easily corrected by peforming a `Terraform Plan` followed by a `Terraform Apply`.  This will detect the unwanted changes and correct them.

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure

Best practice is to place all modules in a dedicated modules directory, with each module nested underneath in seperate directory.  Each module directory must have the required terraform files e.g. `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `README.md`

### Sourcing Modules

The `source`` argument in a module block tells Terraform where to find the source code for the desired child module.  We can source modules from various locations:

- [Locally](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#local-paths)
- [GitHub](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#github)
- [Terraform Registry](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#terraform-registry)
- [S3 Buckets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#s3-bucket)

Example:

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to the module.  The module has to declare these input variables in it's own `variables.tf`, but note they also must be declared in the root variables.tf as well.

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```
