# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1 Journal

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
- PROJECT_ROOT
  |-- variables.tf           # stores the structure of input variables
  |-- main.tf                # everything else 
  |-- providers.tf           # defined required providers and their configuration
  |-- outputs.tf             # stores our outputs
  |-- terraform.tfvars       # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
  |-- README.md              # required for TF modules
```

## Terraform Cloud Variables

In Terraform Cloud we can set two kinds of variables

- Environment Variables - shell variables that you would normally set in your shell profile and are used during plan and apply runs in the cloud 
- Terraform Variables - variables that you would normally set in your terraform.tfvars file

When creating variables in Terraform Cloud, you can set them to be sensitive so they can no longer be viewed after being input.

## Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag

We can use the `-var` flag to override a defined input variable in the terraform.tfvars file at run time 

### var-file flag

To set lots of variables, it is more convenient to specify their values in a variable definitions file (with a filename ending in either .tfvars or .tfvars.json) and then specify that file on the command line with -var-file:

### terraform.tfvars 

this is the default file that is used to bring in variables in bulk

### auto.tvfars

Terraform auto loads tfvars files only when they are named terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json.

Is it possible to ensure that tfvars files following custom naming schemes are loaded automatically?

It is in fact possible to name your file whatever you wish and have Terraform load it automatically. All we have to do is provide the file name with .auto.tfvars as an extension. Letâ€™s try it out.

## Dealing with Configuration Drift

### Fix Missing resources with Terraform Import

If your state file is lost you can can use [Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import) to import existing resources back into your Terraform State.

### Fix Manual Configuration of Resources

If resources have been manually changed via ClickOps but the original configuration is in your state file, this can be easily corrected by peforming a `Terraform Plan` followed by a `Terraform Apply`.  This will detect the unwanted changes and correct them.

## Terraform Modules

[Terraform Modules Tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/modules/module)
[Terraform Modules Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules)

### Terraform Module Structure

Best practice is to place all modules in a dedicated modules directory, with each module nested underneath in seperate directory.  Each module directory must have the required terraform files e.g. `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `README.md`

### Sourcing Modules

The `source`` argument in a module block tells Terraform where to find the source code for the desired child module.  We can source modules from various locations:

- [Locally](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#local-paths)
- [GitHub](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#github)
- [Terraform Registry](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#terraform-registry)
- [S3 Buckets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#s3-bucket)

Example:

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to the module.  The module has to declare these input variables in it's own `variables.tf`, but note they also must be declared in the root variables.tf as well.

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

## Setup AWS S3 Bucket Static Website Hosting

### Enable S3 Static Website Hosting on a Bucket
AWS S3 Static Website hosting can be configured via Terraform using

[Terraform AWS Provider S3 Bucket Website Hosting Configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_website_configuration#website_endpoint)

### Upload required website files to the bucket

While Terraform is perhaps not the optimal tool for uploading files to S3, it can be done using the `aws_s3_object` resource type.  Note that there is also a resource type called `aws_s3_bucket_object` but this resource type has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the Provider so should no longer be used.

[Terraform AWS Provider S3 Object Resource type](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_object)

## Working with Files in Terraform

[Filesystem and Workspace Info](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#filesystem-and-workspace-info)

### Path Variables

In terraform there is a special variable called path that allows us to reference local paths:

- path.module - get the path for the current module
- path.root - is the filesystem path of the root module of the configuration.

### Computing ETAGs using File MD5

etags are used to identify changes in the contents of a file. It's used to determine whether an object has changed since the last request.   We can calculate an etag on an object to determine whether it has changed since the last apply and thus trigger it to be re-uploaded.

Terraform has many built in functions, one of which is the `filemd5` function which can be used to calculate an MD5 hash on the *contents* a file

[Terraform filemd5](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/filemd5)

### File Exists Function

Built in function to check if a file exists.   Example:

```tf
variable "error_html_filepath" {
  description = "Local file path to the error.html file"
  type        = string

  validation {
    condition     = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
    error_message = "The specified HTML file path does not exist."
  }
```

## Terraform Locals

Locals allow us to define local variables. 

### Terraform Data Sources 

*Data sources* allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions.

[Terraform Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)

A data source is accessed via a special kind of resource known as a data resource, declared using a `data`` block:

```tf
data "aws_ami" "example" {
  most_recent = true

  owners = ["self"]
  tags = {
    Name   = "app-server"
    Tested = "true"
  }
}
```

A data block requests that Terraform read from a given data source ("aws_ami") and export the result under the given local name ("example"). The name is used to refer to this resource from elsewhere in the same Terraform module, but has no significance outside of the scope of a module.

## Working with JSON

You can encode JSON inside your Terraform HCL using the `jsonencode` function.   [jsonencode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode)

We used this to embed a bucket policy into our Terraform bucket policy code.
